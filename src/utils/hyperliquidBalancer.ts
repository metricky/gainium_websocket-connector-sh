/**
 * Hyperliquid user-stream balancer.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   - The main user-stream service runs in `balancer` mode (default).
 *     It owns the existing `usersStreamAction` rabbit queue and routes
 *     non-HL events to its local handlers as before. HL open/close
 *     events are forwarded to one of the configured worker servers.
 *   - Each worker runs the same binary in `worker` mode and listens on
 *     `usersStream:worker:<id>`. Workers behave like the existing
 *     user-stream service: they hold the WS connections.
 *   - Hyperliquid caps simultaneous WS connections at 10 per IP, so each
 *     worker handles up to 10 unique HL users; with N workers we get
 *     N × 10 capacity.
 *
 * State (Redis-backed so the balancer is essentially stateless on
 * restart):
 *   `userStream:assignment:<uuid>`   → JSON `{ workerId, openPayload }`
 *   `userStream:worker:<id>:boot`    → bootEpoch (set on worker start)
 *   `userStream:worker:<id>:hb`      → heartbeat (TTL = 3 × heartbeat)
 *   `userStream:lastBoot:<id>`       → balancer-side last-seen bootEpoch
 *
 * Reconciliation runs every `heartbeat` seconds:
 *   - missing `hb` ⇒ worker dead ⇒ rebalance its users to other workers
 *   - `boot` changed since last seen ⇒ worker restarted ⇒ re-send opens
 *     so the worker re-establishes the WS subscriptions
 *
 * Idempotency: `openStreamCallback` already increments `subscribersMap`
 * for repeat opens, so re-sends after a worker restart are harmless.
