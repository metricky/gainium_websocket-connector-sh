## [1.8.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- Self-hosted admin-config sync (gated by `ADMIN_CONFIG_ENABLED`). Reads
  `gainium:admin:enabled_exchanges` from Redis, subscribes to
  `gainium:admin:config` pubsub, and runs a 10s periodic refresh as a
  safety net. When the flag is off (cloud / unflagged) every code path
  is a hard no-op — no Redis subscriber, no timers, no log lines.
